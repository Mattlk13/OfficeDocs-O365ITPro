## Turn off or on Outlook calendar sync in Planner using PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell and run the following command to turn off Outlook calendar sync for Planner:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-PlannerConfiguration -AllowCalendarSharing $false
   ```

   To turn Outlook calendar sync back on in Planner:

   ```PowerShell

   ```

2. To verify your settings, run:

   ```PowerShell
   Get-PlannerConfiguration
   ```
   - In Planner, go to **Planner** > **My Tasks**. Select the ellipses (...). Outlook calendar sync is enabled if you see the **Add "My Tasks" to Outlook calendar** command, and disabled if you don't.
