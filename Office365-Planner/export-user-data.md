# Export user data from Microsoft Planner

This article describes how a global admin can export data for a specific user from Microsoft Planner. The exported data will include data about the user contained in Planner, and also data contained in plans that the user was a part of. The exporting process is done through Windows PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> A global admin can export Microsoft Planner user telemetry data through the [Data Log Export Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872273) on the [Microsoft Service Trust Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872274).

## Prerequisites for making Planner changes in Windows PowerShell

Follow the steps in [Prerequisites for making Planner changes in Windows PowerShell](prerequisites-for-powershell.md) to make Planner changes in Windows PowerShell.

## To export user content from Planner

1. From Windows PowerShell, use the Export-PlannerUserContent cmdlet to export your user's content from Planner.

   ```PowerShell
   Export-PlannerUserContent -UserAadIdOrPrincipalName <user's AADId or UPN> -ExportDirectory <output location>
   ```

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---|---|
    |UserAadIdOrPrincipalName|Use either the Azure Active Directory ID or the UPN of the user for which you want to export content.|
    |ExportDirectory|Location to store your output files. The folder should already exist.|
    |HostName|You only need to use this parameter if you access Planner though a host name other than *task.</span>office.</span>com*. For example, if you access Planner through *tasks.</span>office365.</span>us*, include *-HostName tasks.</span>office365</span>.us* in your command.|
    
    For example, the following will export Adam Barr's user information from Planner using his UPN, and will download the export files to the location C:\PlannerExportAdamBarr.

   ```PowerShell
    Export-PlannerUserContent -UserAadIdOrPrincipalName adambarr@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -ExportDirectory C:\PlannerExportAdamBarr
   ```

2. You'll be prompted to authenticate. Log in as yourself (the global admin), not the user you want to export.

3. After the PowerShell cmdlet runs successfully, go to your export location to view your user's exported data files.

## What gets exported and how to read it

After running the PowerShell cmdlet to export your user's data from Planner, you will receive two types of files in your download location folder:

- A single user file in json format with information about the user.
- One json file for each plan in which the user:
    - Has a task assigned to them.
    - Has a task created by them.

## How to read your exported files

You can use the information in this section to help you understand the properties you will see in both the user and plan json files you received.

|Plan.Tasks.Recurrence.Schedule.Pattern.Interval|The interval applied to the cadence kind. Values greater than 1 mean that a period will be skipped. Examples: for a Daily pattern, an Interval of 2 means tasks will recur every two days (or every other day). For a monthly pattern, an Interval of 3 means tasks will recur every three months (aka quarterly).|
|Plan.Tasks.Recurrence.Schedule.Pattern.DaysOrDates|Each entry in this collection represents the definition of exactly one day or date.
