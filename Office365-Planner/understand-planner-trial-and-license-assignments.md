# Understand Planner trials and license assignments for administrators

Within your organization's account, your users may have a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 license that provides them with access to [Microsoft Planner](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/task-management-software). These users can access Planner either through the web (https://tasks.microsoft.com), or through [the newly updated application in Microsoft Teams called Planner](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.planner?source=app-details-dialog). As users explore the benefits of Planner, they might discover that they want more advanced work management capabilities. Signing up for a trial allows users to experience Planner's premium features for 30 days.

## 30-day trial of premium features

When users follow the prompts to enable a 30-day trial, they're provided access to all the features and functionality in a license for Project Plan 3. Project Plan 3 includes task history, advanced dependencies, custom calendars, timeline (Gantt) view, sprints, custom fields, team workload, managing goal. Once the trial starts, users can access these features within the Planner app in Teams, or with Project for the Web (https://project.microsoft.com).

>![IMPORTANT]
> Copilot in Planner (preview) has begun to roll out. Once your organization receives this product update, you will be able to experience the available Copilot functionality with your Project Plan 3 or Plan 5 license, or within a 30-day trial.


During the trial period, users can explore the full range of functionalities offered by the plan, receiving insights into how it can benefit their workflow and project management tasks. At the end of the 30-day trial period, the user can send a request to their Microsoft 365 administrator for a premium license.

## Administrator approval of a license request

As an administrator, you can manage license assignments within your organization. You have options to manage the incoming license requests following the 30-day trial, including:

- **Process individual license requests**: When a user requests a license, you receive a notification in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC). You can accept or deny these requests individually using the **Licenses** tab located under **Billing**. Within the **Requests** tab, you can see all the submitted requests, and assign the licenses one at a time or in bulk.

- **Select the license to assign**: Select a request and then choose from an available license via the drop-down menu under **Select a product**. You can see the number of available licenses, so you can manage these requests by plan.

## More controls for the administrator

- **Monitor product usage**: After a user starts a trial, you can track product usage metrics within the MAC to determine which users can benefit most from a permanent license.

- **Enable or disable license requests**: Within the MAC, you can enable or disable the option for people in your organization to request a license. This gives you control over who can access the trial and when.

- **Self-service purchases**: Users can opt to purchase a license independently. While you can't assign or unassign licenses for these purchases, [you can take over the subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins?view=o365-worldwide#take-over-a-self-service-purchase-or-trial-subscription&preserve-view=true) and manage it accordingly.
