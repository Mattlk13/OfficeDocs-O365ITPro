# Microsoft Planner limits

This article describes the current limits that apply to Microsoft Planner.

## Plan limits

|Field  |Limit  |
|---------|---------|
|Maximum active tasks in a plan    |2400|
|Maximum buckets in a plan    |200|
|Maximum plans owned by a group or user     |200|
|Maximum plans that a user can subscribe to delta-sync for    |300|

> [!NOTE]
> - An active task is a task that is not completed.
> - Delta sync lets users passively receive updates in real-time while the app is open. Users beyond the delta-sync limits will not see updates in real-time.
> - Most Planner plans are owned by a group. Plans created by other apps, and shown in Planner, may be owned by a user.
> - A context is the association between a plan and a host container like a Teams tab. The limit on contexts is a limit on how many associations a plan can have.
