# Kaizala Actions

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Actions help people get work done through a conversation in Kaizala. Some Actions – like Jobs, Surveys, and Polls – are ready out-of-the-box with predefined settings. Once you publish an Action, people can find it in the Kaizala app and use it in a conversation from the Action Palette.

You can create new Kaizala Actions through the Action Designer, found in the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la).
