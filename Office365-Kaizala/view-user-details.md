# View user details in Kaizala

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

To find a detailed view of a user's profile:
 
1. On the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la), from the left navigation bar, select **Directory**.
2. Select a user from the user list for your organization.    
3. Select the user to see the user's details.

On a user's details page, you can find:

- Display name
- Kaizala profile picture
- Phone number
- Other organization attributes

You can also find common groups between you and the other user (for whom you are viewing details). You can remove the user from groups of which you are an admin. At the same time, you can promote or remove a user as admin.

If you are a tenant admin, you can also find a **Delete user** button, if the concerned user is not linked to Microsoft Entra ID.
