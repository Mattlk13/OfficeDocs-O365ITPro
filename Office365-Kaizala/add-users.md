# Add users to the organization directory in Kaizala

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Before you can send instant messages, pictures, and documents, or set up a new poll or survey, you'll have to create or add Kaizala users in your organization. You can add users individually or in bulk. For managing users in groups, see [Kaizala groups](groups-in-kaizala.md).

Organization admins can create or add new users in [organization directory networks](od-network.md). However, users when added by a group admin in any organization group also become a part of the organization directory.

Users can be added to the Employee network in any of the following ways:

- Users added by an organization admin as Employees, either in bulk or individually.
- Users synced automatically from Microsoft Entra ID.
- Users who have signed in to their Kaizala mobile app using an Office 365 account.

Similarly, users can be added to the Others network:

- Non-employee users added by a group admin to their organization groups.
- Users added by an organization admin as Others, either in bulk or individually.

However, tenant admins can always move a user between networks.
  
## Add users in bulk to your organization directory

If you want to add several users at once, you can do so using the **Import Users** option. 
  
1. On the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la), from the left navigation bar, select **Directory**.
2. Open the **Employee** tab or the **Others** tab.
3. Select **Import Users**.
4. On the **Import Users** dialog box, download the CSV template. See how to [add several users at the same time to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/1f5767ed-e717-4f24-969c-6ea9d412ca88#__toc316652088).
5. Follow the template to add your users and their phone numbers to Kaizala. Save the file in .csv format.
6. Select **Select a File**, choose the file you previously saved, and select **Upload**. 
7. On the **Upload Users History** page, you can check the status of the uploaded file. Select **Refresh** to get the latest status. If the status is **Completed**, you can find the updated user list under the earlier selected network â€“ Employee or Others. 
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can update information for an existing user by re-uploading the file with updated data for that user. 
  
## Find history of all user upload operations

   - **Status** of the uploaded file. This can be one of the following values:
