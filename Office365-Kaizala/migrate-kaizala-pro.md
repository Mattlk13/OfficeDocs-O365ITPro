# Migrate Kaizala Pro subscriptions to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 versions

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Effective July 1, 2020, Microsoft is ending sales of the Kaizala Pro standalone service. You'll no longer be able to purchase new Kaizala Pro subscriptions after this date, and existing Kaizala Pro subscriptions won't renew automatically when they expire.

Kaizala and Teams will continue to be accessible as part of the Microsoft 365 and Office 365 plans listed below. If you have one of the licenses listed below, you'll still be able to access the Kaizala service through these licenses. Otherwise, to continue accessing the Kaizala service, click on the links below to learn more about these Microsoft 365 and Office 365 solutions.

Microsoft is in the process of adding Kaizala Pro capabilities into Microsoft Teams, ultimately replacing the Microsoft Kaizala service. You can find information on the Kaizala features coming to Microsoft Teams [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-kaizala-blog/update-on-kaizala-features-coming-to-microsoft-teams/ba-p/974525).  This change is being implemented to assure new and renewing customers are licensed to easily transition from Kaizala to Teams.
