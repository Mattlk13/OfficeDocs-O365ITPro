# Delete users from the organization directory in Kaizala

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Organization admins only can delete users from an organization. They can delete users one at a time or delete multiple users at the same time.

## Delete a single user

1. On the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la), from the left navigation bar, select **Directory**.
2. Select a user from the user list for your organization.
3. Click on that user to see that user's detailed view.
4. Select **Delete**.

## Delete multiple users

1. On the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la), from the left navigation bar, select **Directory**.
2. Select the users from the network-specific user list that you want to delete. A maximum of 100 users can be selected.
3. Select **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> - Microsoft Entra ID linked users cannot be deleted from the Kaizala organization directory using Kaizala management portal.
> - If a Microsoft Entra user is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID, the user is automatically deleted from the Kaizala organization directory.

Once you delete a user, that user gets removed from all organizational groups on Kaizala. All data – including messages, Kaizala Actions, and attachments – for these groups will be deleted from the user's device.
